# BankruptcyProbabilityAndEffectOnFirmsPerformance

The objective of this project is to first replicate the result from the paper “In Search of Distress Risk” by systematically evaluating the data collected from WRDS databases and building a predicting model before attempting to extend the paper. To make a stronger, more accurate model, the team will continue to explore a more diverse range of features, including features generated from SEC filings in addition to the original prediction features.This section of the project focused on accurate data collection, with an emphasis put on replicating the data outlined in the paper.
